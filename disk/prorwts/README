some test code for using large 32MB prodos hard-drive images

this is based on the prorwts code by qkumba, and also the
	4cade/total-replay code by 4am and qkumba

currently code here only work on hd image, and unlike 4cade
won't work as double-clicking a disk image on a IIgs as that's not
really a use case I would ever do
