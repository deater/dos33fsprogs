This is a widely varied set of software and assets.

In general any code purely written by me is under GPL v2.0-only
I'm usually fine dual-licensing things MIT as well but if it's not
explicit you can check with me and I can update things to be clear.

There is some other code included here which has other licenses though
so be careful if using it.
