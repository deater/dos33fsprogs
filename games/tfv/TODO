+ update speaker_tone.s

short-term:
+ Finish mockingboard music (victory and battle)
+ Get battle finished
	- hook up name
	- sound effects (during battle?  magic specifically)
	- if not enough magic points, grey out? somehow
		the ones we can't cast
	- adjust color of fight background based on ground color
	- randomize/generic enemy
	- handle dying properly (game over at bottom of screen)
+ load game support
+ merge the credits and battle mockingboard code if possible
+ for the victory music, add pause before playing, adjust tempo
+ add "story" of some sort

get metrocat by running across him on world map


proper slowdown/delay in attack
simple sound effects when selecting menu
maybe gradients on backgrounds

help:
	different help screen for flying than worldmap

title:
	timeout if no key pressed at splash/title screen


walking around:
	separate background image that says when you can walk
	different colors to indicate who you can talk to

battle:
	spiral intro
	animated intro

load game support

split title and flying off from map play

new or load game

char selector
	male/female
	hair color
	skin color
	name



mode7 speed fixes:

	+  Skip key parsing if no key read

	+ Self modifying code on the adds in inner loop

	+ inline lookup_map (or at least a copy of it)
		maybe code that detects if spacex/spacey add
		incremented and just skip the lookup (avoid the need
		for the cache code)

	+ Unroll inner loop?  Might not help much since we are 
		self-modifying and would have to duplicate
		that.


short term:

longer term:
	sky -- color looks too much like grass on monochrome display
	map -- adjust x/y to better match real position
	name entry screen
	inventory screen
	collision detection
	after game over, return to title screen
	save/restore game
