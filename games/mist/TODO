FIXME:
+ use zx02 compression
+ use updated/proper audio in the speaker_beeps.s (from music/redbook_sound)


KNOWN BUGS
+ The bounding box for the button in the fireplace should probably be at least
	two pixels higher, it's hard to hit
+ For the white page, in the actual game the dock switch you possibly have
	to toggle it at least once before the door opens
	(currently if it's down and the rest up it's auto open)
+ Maybe not fixable, but at the cabin if you open the door then you can't
	exit to the south
+ During the mysterium playthrough, the machine rebooted when going up
	the steps in stoneship, not sure why
+ Would be nice someday if we could speedrun w/o having to swap disks
	(though for humor value it's fun)


mockingboard on IIc?
Need to set the values in detect so it's detected
with that though it instantly blazes through the song, as if sei isn't
working.  unclear why


For release 1.0

+ QLOAD

+ LOADER 

+ MIST
	-- open door to clock puzzle?
	-- another stop on path to spaceship.  Out of room though :(
	-- MIST_ROCKET_PATH_PAD probably missing ship-raised background
	-- (reported by user) the generator entrance/path just shows
		open hand icon so it's unclear you can take the path in
		addition to entering the generator.  Not much we can
		do about that with the current engine though

+ OCTAGON
	-- animation on the fireplace opening/closing
	-- load "red page" sound clip into LC and play it?
	-- show "burnt" books if click on non-avail book
	-- adjust grabbing of actual books
	-- longer speeches from brothers, most notably the
		page 5 speeches and ending

+ SELENA
	-- load 1s clip of sounds (4k each) into language card?

+ STONEY
	-- allow coming at steps from an angle

+ CHANNEL
	-- from path can still see down elev1 even if up
	-- rotate windmill if enabled?

+ ARBOR
	-- rotate windmill if enabled?
	-- missing treehouses
	-- can look down elevator1 shaft if not there

+ NIBEL
	-- turn on sprite crop in the viewer part
		[harder to do this than you might think]

+ MECHE
	-- animations for elevator
	-- way to turn around in basement
	-- make rotation more similar to actual game?

+ SUB


Done:
+ CABIN
+ DENTIST
+ DNI
+ MIST_TITLE
+ SHIP
+ VIEWER
	-- real game can erase message?

TODO Maybe future:

MIST:
+ look at catherine's letter from other side of path
+ Make clock puzzle more similar to actual game

OCTAGON:

+ line drawing on map isn't optimal
+ should hints be black on white text?

General:
+ Insert floppy #100 joke?
+ double link noise (once when leave, once when get there?)

	not too hard to implement?

MECHE age:

+ reduce size by using flipped-background attribute(?)

SELENA age:
+ optional mockingboard sound for keyboard?
+ sound
	5 sound effects (not digital samples)
	maybe not bother with aiming antennas, but sum button plays

+ better colors
