[opening monologue, to the player]
Thank God you've returned.
I need your help.

There's a great deal of history that
you should know, but I'm afraid that...
I must continue my writing. Here.

[hands the player his journal]
Most of what you'll need to know is in
there.
Keep it well hidden.

[picks up a book]
For reasons you'll discover, I can't
send you to Riven with a way out, but
I can give you this.

It appears to be a Linking Book, back
here to D'ni, but it's actually a
one-man prison. You'll need it,
I'm afraid, to capture Gehn.
[hands the player the Prison Book]

Once you've found Catherine, signal me,
and I'll come with a Linking Book
to bring us back.

[writes in the Book of Riven, then closes it,
 opens it to its first page, and holds it up,
 showing the blurred descriptive panel]

There's also a chance, if all goes
well, that I might be able to get you
back to the place that you came from.
