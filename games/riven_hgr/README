Riven on a Floppy Disk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AKA how much of the 5-CD-ROM game RIVEN will fit on a 140k Apple II Floppy

Just as it says, how much "hi-res" Riven can you fit on a floppy disk.
Hand converted locations packed with ZX02 compression.

Maglev scene (the real reason I did this) was rotoscoped in 40x48 "lores".
	
The website probably has a more complete rundown on everything going on here

Building this assumes you have zx02, the ca65 assembler, and various of
	my dos33fsutils in proper places.  Sorry.
