move flip_pages.s into QLOAD?


+ disk handling code
	+ on every load check to make sure disk hasn't been swapped?
		can put expected disk number at beginning of each thing
		we load and compare against it

+ Keyboard handling
	- still buggy, especially when clicking on something???
	- Better keyboard handling on IIe
	-> was actually one of the main reasons I started working on this


title:
	-> maybe have "new game / load game" shown?

disk00:
	+ cyan intro
		use page flipping on Apple IIe with auxmem?
	+ atrus intro
	+ capture movie:
		more frames for riven intro
		sound effect
		fade in effect
	+ opening movie: implement it
		ESC key... in wait_a_bit write to WAIT_KEYPRESS

disk01:
	+ maybe redo opening graphics

disk39:
	-> try to fit more locations
		+ outside/overlook_s is there but won't fit
		+ projector_e also there, prob will fit
		+ re-arrange disk so projector gets the extra 4k

	-> try to fit last little bit of maglev sequence
		+ do the handle animation at end?
		+ sound effects?
		+ if out of room in RAM (but not disk)
			optionally load tail end
			to language card on machines that have it?


disk40:
	-> implement maglev flip
	-> implement maglev back

disk41:

disk43:
	-> implement cart
