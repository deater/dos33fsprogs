	- still buggy, especially when clicking on something???
	- Better keyboard handling on IIe

	-> try to fit more locations
		+ outside/overlook_s is there but won't fit
		+ projector_e also there, prob will fit
		+ re-arrange disk so projector gets the extra 4k

	-> try to fit last little bit of maglev sequence
		+ do the handle animation at end?
		+ sound effects?
		+ if out of room in RAM (but not disk)
			optionally load tail end
			to language card on machines that have it?
