+ common
	+ move change-disk message to be in TITLE?
	  how to handle if multiple exits to level?
        + add code to actually detect if disk changed and skip
		title screen in that case
	+ add language card/sound detection in case we add sound effects
	

+ Keyboard handling
	- still buggy, especially when clicking on something???
	- Better keyboard handling on IIe
	-> was actually one of the main reasons I started working on this

	-> allow flipping maglev back.  Should just be a matter of
		playing movie in reverse

	-> try to fit more locations
		+ outside/overlook_s is there but won't fit
		+ projector_e also there, prob will fit
		+ re-arrange disk so projector gets the extra 4k

	-> try to fit last little bit of maglev sequence
		+ do the handle animation at end?
		+ sound effects?
		+ if out of room in RAM (but not disk)
			optionally load tail end
			to language card on machines that have it?
