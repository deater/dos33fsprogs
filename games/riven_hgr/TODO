share code in QLOAD to free up room in levels


disk39:
	-> try to fit more locations
		have one already done that didn't fit (overlook otherway)
	-> try to fit last little bit of maglev sequence
		+ do the handle animation at end?
		+ sound effects?
		+ if out of room in RAM (but not disk)
			optionally load tail end
			to language card on machines that have it?

+ Better keyboard handling on IIe
	-> was actually one of the main reasons I started working on this
