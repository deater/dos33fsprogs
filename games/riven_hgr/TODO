+ disk handling code
	+ on every load check to make sure disk hasn't been swapped?
		can put expected disk number at beginning of each thing
		we load and compare against it
	+ allow pressing escape to back-out disk change?

+ Keyboard handling
	- Better keyboard handling on IIe
	-> was actually one of the main reasons I started working on this

qload:
+ move flip_pages.s into QLOAD

title:

disk00:
	+ cyan intro
		use page flipping on Apple IIe with auxmem?
	+ atrus intro
	+ capture movie:
	+ opening movie: implement it
		ESC key... in wait_a_bit write to WAIT_KEYPRESS
		allow skipping chunks of it

disk01:
	+ maybe redo opening graphics

disk38:
	-> complete things

disk39:
	-> try to fit last little bit of maglev sequence
		+ do the handle animation at end?
		+ sound effects?
		+ if out of room in RAM (but not disk)
			optionally load tail end
			to language card on machines that have it?
disk40:
	-> implement maglev flip
	-> implement maglev back

disk41:
	-> see if we can implement left/straight right/straight
		options for fork-in-road type situations

disk43:
	-> implement cart
	-> fix up graphics
	-> fix up path
	-> again, figure out fork-in-road handling

disk50:
	-> implement reverse cart
