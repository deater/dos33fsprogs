since taking a break, what I had planned:
	+ finish 2 missing locations (and 3 artworks) in rotating room
	+ disk37 which would be first maglev with it not there, and
		the animation once the button is pressed
	+ mine cart animation
	+ animate an ending, probably the bad one moving telescope
	+ hook up bare minimum so you can go from book island
		to suvery to jungle (via fish) even if most isn't
		actually hooked up
	+ hook up rotating room puzzle



General:
	press escape to skip cutscenes?

+ disk handling code
	+ on every load check to make sure disk hasn't been swapped?
		can put expected disk number at beginning of each thing
		we load and compare against it
	+ allow pressing escape to back-out disk change?

+ Keyboard handling
	- Better keyboard handling on IIe
	-> was actually one of the main reasons I started working on this

qload:
+ move flip_pages.s into QLOAD


title:

disk00:



disk01:
	+ maybe redo opening graphics

disk02:	(steps)
	one	E
	two	E

	three	E
	four	E

	alcove (EW)?
	rotation noise / sorta animation?
	different views/allowed to walk depending on rotation
	

	bridge1	(nsew)
	
	

disk03: (down other side)
	one		E

	different views through peephole depending on room rotation
	allow walking through doorway depending on room rotation	

disk04: bridge
	add missing N/S views
	allow clicking on chair room door to go direct there

disk05: control room
	blue view should have maglev there/not
	orange view should animate opening door

disk06: more tunnel
	allow clicking on cair room to go direct here
	animate opening door?

disk10:
	figure out rotation


disk38:
	
disk39:
	-> try to fit last little bit of maglev sequence
		+ do the handle animation at end?
		+ sound effects?
		+ if out of room in RAM (but not disk)
			optionally load tail end
			to language card on machines that have it?

disk40:
	-> implement maglev flip
	-> implement maglev back

disk41:
	-> allow going down where animals were, see ball?


disk43:
	-> implement cart ride (maybe move to disk50)
	-> fix up graphics
	-> fix up path
	-> batter fork-in-road handling

disk44:
	-> more path
	-> fish mouth
	-> probably move fish to own disk

disk50:
