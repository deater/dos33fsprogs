walking:
	borders (mostly fixed?  can sometimes walk through trees
	on left even though you shouldn't)
- Archery
  + (done) Archer animations
  + Hook up minigame
  + (done) fix where we can get stuck on top of targets at archery range

  + Fix priority issue where it doesn't cut off at the edge of the desk
	properly.
	Not sure if we need to move desk or to somehow fix the priority
	code cutoff
