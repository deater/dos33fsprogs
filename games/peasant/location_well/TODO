+ better looking mask-in-bucket sprite?
+ draw crank-over-face better (currently sprite over-writes face)
+ Adjust well priority mask when bucket up/down
+ Fix the "crank up" animation.  Maybe look at it when setting up baby
+ Animate baby in well
+ can re-use some of the sprites/masks in the well animations to save space

+ (done) put pebbles in bucket animation
		walk over (doesn't check for closeness)
		crank animates turning and bucket goes down
		
+ (done) in actual game, walking down center pops you out gap in
		trees ar archery walking to left pops you out the trees
		on left, but you can't go back that way

+ (done) walk to well when "turn crank"
		When out of bounds says "you can't reach from there"
		Bounds are somewhat narrow rectangular region from left
		of well to tree and not to top/bottom it will walk you there

+ (done) turn crank again walk over to left of well	
		"you got a short reach to match..

+ (done) Have it remember state of well when off screen and restore it
