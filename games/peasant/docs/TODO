getting points:
	merge with message print so it prints message and plays sound.
	adds some delay for message but also if playing with sound off
	you aren't surprised by the weird pause


walking:
	sub-pixel walking left/right?  Currently we walk too fast
	Maybe even add sierra-style +/-

load/save:
	add autosave feature?
	(done) move savegame to disk2?

	loading game might trigger "borders.s" adjustments.
		should skip if exit type is load

general engine:
	the "check haystack" code is missing from some locations.
		it should really be a generic "countdown/check all states"
		code to see when things like rain/etc run out
	maybe have exiting x,y data in new_map_location somehow?
	updated qload code (???)

sound:
	fix/add sound effects for rocks/lightning
	use updated speaker_beeps.s from music/redbook_sound
	use updates ssi263 code from wargames
		or alternately use SAM
	check if newer pt3_lib needed
	-- Kerrek one is off
	-- Various trogdor ones might use some help too

input code:
	(done) once active, leave it up on screen with >
	(done) maybe leave it active all the time?
	(done) if move to next screen and active, preserve it
	(done) fix "version" not working?


General:
~~~~~~~~
+ wait for screen refresh on IIe/IIc/IIgs
+ (???) make text every 9th row so descenders don't interfere?
+ background priority mask not working when at far top of screen
+ fix issue where walking stops when you cross to screen w priority
  (most visible, mountain pass to river)



QUESTIONS FOR VIDELECTRIX:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ What are the odds of Kerrek appearing each time you enter?
  It seems like if you enter from a screen and he's not there then
     he'll never appear from that direction unless you enter from
     a different direction


Peasant sprites:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Wearing haystack
+ Muddy

Text parsing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ (???) always load CURERENT_NOUN into A before calling into parsing
	routines

Each time enter room:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Have kerrek decay more
+ Check for night being over
+ Check for rain being done
+ Update map visited location
+ Blow away haystack if applicable


Loading Screen:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ (done) Move all save games into one sector
+ (????) After loading, no need to clear text before moving to next level
+ After loading, clear xadd/yadd so not walking
