- Ned Cottage

  + Make door open once baby deployed
  + door near end of deploy is missing bottom line
  + double check timing of whole thing
  + animate broom falling
  + fix priority for door
  + reload original priority when done
  + change priority swap to be patch style rather than zx02 style
	this would avoid possibly stomping on video holes

  + (done) enter x/y (mostly near fence)
  + (done) re-draw background and fence
