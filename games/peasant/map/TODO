+ (done) draw things as you visit
+ (done) peasant head at current location
+ (done) peasant head should blink

+ head location when in trogdor's inner sanctum maybe should be
	one notch up from when you are on cliff heights

notes:
	note: has one head location for each map square
		(i.e. it's not based on your x/y of your location in the level)
	if you're inside a building it just shows you on the map outside
	if you're in the hidden glen it shows you off the map to the side

	if you're on the cliff and beyond it shows you off the map the
		the right of the knight location

	there are possibly more mountains on a totally blank map
