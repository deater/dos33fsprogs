	Peasant's Quest for Apple II update newsletter

Recent changes: (version 0.85 released)
	+ Now is on 3 disks instead of 2.  Much more annoying to play with
	  actual floppy disks but makes other things work better
	+ Added support for hard drive image.  If your emulator supports
	  this then no need to swap floppies at all.  Also this is good
	  for emulators where you can't swap floppies (like the internet
	  archive in-browser one)
	+ Updated input code to match the original game behavior
	  (before it had a hacked-together proof-of-concept way for typing
	  things in)
	+ Started merging in the updated peasant sprite support.  For now
	  only in intro.  Still has issues.
	+ You can play through most of the game, though many animations
	  and sprite-changes not implemented yet.  Currently you get stuck
	  at the cliff climb as I haven't merged that code in yet.
	  If you have a save game at the top you can complete the game
	  (but parts of the final cliff-top sequence are missing)
