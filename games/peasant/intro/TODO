+ escape takes a while to take effect when walking for some reason
+ add "walk to support"
+ (done) update knight level (remove knight from bg, then draw sprite)
+ move "ok to start" comment to knight level
+ adjust timing of walking so time to read messages
+ see if we can size-optimize to get knight code back from MUSIC
