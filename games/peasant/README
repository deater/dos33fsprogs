The start of an implementation of PEASANT'S QUEST

Peasant's Quest is a Flash game sort of parodying early Sierra adventure
games.

In the Homestarrunner universe it is made by a company for Videlectrix
possibly on Apple IIe systems, though the graphics are for a much
more modern system.

I wanted to see if I could get something approximating the game
running on an actual Apple II system.
