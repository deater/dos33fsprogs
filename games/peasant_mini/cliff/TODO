Erase flame even when not moving?  That is tricky as would need to
	redraw head as well :(  maybe just erase part above the head?
	or just draw peasant always, even when not moving,
	you don't have to erase

add collision detection for boulders
adjust boulder fall frequency to match original

collision detect head and feet?

For Coach Z version:
	Speed up rocks/change spawn rate above level2
