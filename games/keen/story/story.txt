   WHAT THE VORTICONS HAVE STOLEN
#normal

THE BEAN-WITH-BACOM MEGAROCKET WAS
CONSTRUCTED FROM OBJECTS AROUND THE
HOUSE THAT YOU HAVE "MODIFIED" INTO
STARSHIP PARTS:

* JOYSTICK (FROM YOUR BROTHER'S VIDEO
GAME) MANUAL FLIGHT CONTROL.

* CAR BATTERY (FROM YOUR MOM'S CAR)
ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS POWER

* VACUUM CLEANER (FROM THE KITCHEN,
HEAVILY MODIFIED) ION PROPULSION UNIT
(WITH CARPET HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT).

* EVERCLEAR (FROM YOUR DAD'S LIQUOR
CABINET) FUEL.


THE VORTICONS HAVE TAKEN THESE PIECES
TO THE FAR REACHES OF MARS AND ARE
GUARDING THEM.  YOU MUST FIND THE
MEMBERS OF THIS VORTICON OUTPOST AND
WREST THE PARTS BACK FROM THEIR
WICKED, CLAWED HANDS!

         INFORMATION ON MARS
#normal

UNBEKNOWNST TO NASA, WHEN THE VIKING
LANDER SETTLED TO THE SURFACE OF MARS,
IT CAUSED A MAJOR POLITICAL UPHEVAL.
VIKING ACTUALLY LANDED ON THE DESPOTIC
MARTIAN KING!  THE YORPS (THE
EXTREMELY FRIENDLY ONE-EYED MARTIANS)
WERE FREE FROM ENSLAVEMENT, AND THE
GARGS (THE VICIOUS, AGGRESSIVE
MARTIANS) WERE ANGRY.

THE MARTIANS CREATED ROBOTS FOR MENIAL
WORK AND GUARD DUTIES.  BEWARE OF THE
TANK-LIKE GUARD ROBOTS--THEY ARE VERY
GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO.

MARTIANS HAVE BEEN VISITING EARTH IN
UFOS FOR DECADES.  WHY?  THEY COME TO
EARTH FOR ONE REASON--THEY WANT OUR
TOYS.  HULA HOOPS AND SKATEBOARDS ARE
HOLY OBJECTS TO THEM!  WHO KNOWS...YOU
MAY FIND SOME TOYS USEFUL!

THERE ARE SIGNS EVERYWHERE.  YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DECIPHER THEM
YET....
