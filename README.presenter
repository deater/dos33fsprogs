ASOFT_PRESENTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background:

   I was inspired to write this when a co-worked used an iPad for a
   talk.  The iPad is as powerful as early Cray supercomputers;
   why waste that much processing power on a slide show?


In present mode:
   Q quits
   space or -> goes to next slide
   <- goes to previous slide

How to Create Presentations:

   ./asoft_presenter DIRECTORY

   Directory must contain "info" and "footer" files

   In general empty lines (just linefeed) and lines starting with #
   are ignored

   info: has the slide info.  First key is
   TITLE
	 followed by title
	 AUTHOR
	 followed by author
	 EMAIL
	 followed by e-mail
	 SLIDES
	 followed by a list of files to be parsed in-order with slide info
	 END_SLIDES
   TARGET
   followed by the word "plus" to target the Apple II+, or "default" for
   later machines (this mostly affects the keypress detection code)

    footer: has info on footer
         first line: text to be left justified
	 second line: text to be centered

    slide files:
         starting a line with %c% will center the following text

	 First line describes slide type
	    40COL - 40 column text
	    80COL - 80 column text (not implemented)
	    HGR   - HGR with 4-lines of text
	    HGR2  - HGR with no text (note, uses page 1)
	    HGR_PLOT - plots data on HGR display

	  40COL - text as follows is printed to 40 column text display

	  HGR - first line indicates file to BLOAD.
	        following lines are text at bottom

	  HGR2 - first line indicated file to BLOAD
	         actually is page1 (HGR) with soft-switch thrown
		 this is because presentations get so large
		 I load them high by default into HGR page2

	  HGR_PLOT - loads a shape table to $1000 and uses it for
	             labeling axes

	             first line x and y size of data
	             next line how many tick marks on x and y axis
		     START
		     followed by x y NUM where NUM is number to
		         write at x y
		     STOP
		     number of plots
		     for each plot,
		     START
		     color of plot
		     list of data points (x y)
		     STOP

		     Then list of text to put in bottom 4 lines


NOTES while developing:

   ARGH I've been programming in C too long can't handle things that start
   numbering with "1" rather than "0".

   AppleSoft BASIC was my first programming language; it's amazing how
   I can still program it all these years later.

   On-line documentation that can be found for shape table construction
   is misleading at best.  The original BASIC manual is best for this.

   The BASIC code generated is really wasteful, especially for the
   extravagant REM statements.

   I am most proud of the code that puts the slide number at end
   of text w/o scrolling.  There's probably a better way to do it.

   I should probably use page-flipping to avoid flicker, but I use
   so much RAM it might not be doable.  Probably also would
   require assembly.
