Stoneship:
+ Never have to draw a wooden ship again it would be too soon

Selenetic
+ The horrible colors.  Lots of water and sky which were fast to draw,
	but the pillars and clocks and giant vases and crystals
	and strange trees  with lots of colors that
	did not match apple II palette well
  Fog not helping.
  Settled on "light blue" for the color.  Initial attempts at aqua ended
	up being sickly green on some displays
  Then the underground tunnels with the intricate wall art.
	Don't get me started on the submarine "puzzle"


Channelwood:
+ Pain drawing the water, and trees, and boardwalk,rocks.
	At least no bricks or checkered floor in this age.
  Thought was done with trees on Myst
  Each major junction a hexagon with potentially 6 backgrounds.
  Some of them you could split left or right mid screen.
	In end just did the three ways that didn't need this.
	Made it confusing to navigate at times, but I always felt
	this level was confusing to navigate anyway.
