This is a variant of the "Scroll Block" demo by Otomata Labs
	from Deadline 2024.
	https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=98269

Originally for ZX Spectrum with 48k RAM.

it's mostly just using the graphics by Grongy

music is by MA2E

Impressive they fit all that in 48k of RAM.  I struggled to fit everything
in 60k using ZX02 compression.  Though possibly if I dropped the qkumba
fast load code I might be able to squeeze it into 48k.


requirements:
	Apple II with 64k and Mockingboard
	It requires a Mockingboard as I use timer interrupts to decompress
		the 8k frames in the background.
	IIgs probably not working as I'd have to have the IRQ handler not
		in the language card, which is possible I just didn't have
		time to stick an indirect somewhere.


To build you'll need to grab the .gif version of the graphic from
	https://zxart.ee/eng/authors/g/grongy/scroll-block-full/
copy it to the ./grongy/ directory and run the convert.sh file to generate
the images
