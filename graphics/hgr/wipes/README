Trying to figure out how the fancy wipes from Total Replay / 4cade work

Designed so can be modular and loaded on the fly, but for our purposes
that doesn't really matter

Summary here best I can tell:
	+ FXCode = current effect, loaded to $6C00

	+ Coordinates1Bit = $8600 = $3480 bytes of data?
	+ Coordinates2Bit = $8100 = $3C00 bytes of data
	+ Coordinates3Bit = $6D00 = 

; depends on $300
	     $200
	     $BB00
	     $BC00
	     $BE00
