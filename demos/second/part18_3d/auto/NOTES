frame50 as benchmark:
	+ raw binary is 1024 bytes (2048 pixels)

hand-crafted:
	+ 25e0 - 24d8 = 264 bytes

todo, compressed:
	+ ???


7680 bytes: try1: all plots, even zeros (4 bytes each pixel)
4537 bytes: try2: all plots, don't write black pixels
3701 bytes: try3: only do color if it changes
2568 bytes: try4: use compact form (only change type if changed)
1194 bytes: try5: use hlin (essentially RLE)
 906 bytes: try6: sort by color first
 628 bytes: try7: initial use boxes
 526 bytes: try8: boxes that optimize to HLIN/VLIN/PLOT
 522 bytes: try9: optimize HLIN to HLIN_ADD variants
 506 bytes: try10: sort types per color
 498 bytes: try11: sort HLIN by Y1

TODO:
	Add don't cares
	Try all color combos
	Sort the color results to have consecutive HLINs together
	MOVE PLOTS one line before HLIN

Possible size boxes
	48x40,39,38....1
