frame50 as benchmark:
	+ raw binary is 1024 bytes (2048 pixels)

hand-crafted:
	+ 25e0 - 24d8 = 264 bytes

todo, compressed:
	+ ???


try1: all plots, even zeros
	+ 2c2 - 20c2 = 7680 bytes (4 bytes each pixel)

try2: all plots, don't write black pixels
	+ 2c2 - 147b = 4537 bytes

try3: only do color if it changes
	+ 2c2 - 1137 = 3701 bytes
