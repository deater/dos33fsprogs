frame50 as benchmark:
	+ raw binary is 1024 bytes (2048 pixels)

hand-crafted:
	+ 25e0 - 24d8 = 264 bytes

todo, compressed:
	+ ???


7680 bytes: try1: all plots, even zeros (4 bytes each pixel)
4537 bytes: try2: all plots, don't write black pixels
3701 bytes: try3: only do color if it changes
2568 bytes: try4: use compact form (only change type if changed)
1194 bytes: try5: use hlin (essentially RLE)
 906 bytes: try6: sort by color first
