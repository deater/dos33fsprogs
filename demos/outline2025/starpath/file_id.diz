Apple II Starpath

256-byte Intro for Apple II, Outline 2025
by Deater / dSr

Based on the 64-byte DOS "starpath" by
Hellmood from Lovebyte 2025

This is the fastest I could get the
raymarching to go on a 6502.  It makes
6k of lookup tables, then draws 32 frames
and then plays them back (taking 32k of
RAM).

Managed to squeeze things down enough
to have some sound, still not sure
it was worth it.

Should run on any Apple II with 48k
or more of RAM
