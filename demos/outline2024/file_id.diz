256-byte Intro for Apple II, Outline 2024
by Deater / dSr

If you zoom in on the bubble universe
you may find cosmic fish.

Apple II 'lo-res' 40x48 15 color mode

Core routine based on serato_fig's
C64 version

A lot of the fun was generating
256-entry sine and cosine tables

Also a 256 entry color-fade table
(complicated as two pixels are in the
top/bottom of a byte and they fade
independently)

There is sound but admittedly it
isn't the best.
