This is yet another tiny Apple II hires/shapetable intro.

It loads at $E7 (HGR_SCALE) so that we set that value
for free from the first instruction (in this case JSR so $20).

I thought this looked like woven cloth at times, hence the name.

I found this one while searching for pleasant looking patterns
in the ROM to display that were easy to load.  Specifically patterns
that have a 0 value after one or two bytes, as those are smaller shapes.
In this case this is rotation value $E2 at address $E2E2 which is
easy to load.
