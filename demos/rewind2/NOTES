Bear: (4k)
	Loads to $6000...$6FFF
	Uses $2000...$5FFF both main and AUX
	Loads image to $A000..$BFFF
	Uses $8000...$9FFF as temporary (to copy to aux) data

Headphones: (6k)
	Loads to $6000...$7FFF in AUX, copied to MAIN before running
	Uses $2000...$5FFF both main and AUX
	Uses $A000...$BFFF both for temporary copy for scrolling

Dancing: (8k)
	Loads to $8000 in AUX at start up, then copied back to
	$2000 in MAIN, then also $2000 in AUX so the decompression
	code up in the language card area can access both

	all images combined compress to 3025/3038 bytes or 128 bytes or so avg
	6202 is total size

	image data (24 frames) Decompress to 24k for main 24k for aux
	decompress starting at $4000 in both
