Horrible hack of the VMW chiptune player code to try to play a 6-channel file.

There's really not enough RAM to do things this way.

Proper solution is to write a real pt3 tracker.



Hacks:
	Needs 10k+10k RAM for each KRW file (converted PT3)
	Needs 14k+14k for buffers
	Needs 4k for player
	==================
		52k RAM, more than we have on stock Apple II

	We cheat and use language card which gives up 64k in theory.

	The problem is we use interrupts, and the interrupt routine is
	hard-coded to jump into the $F000 range.  IIe/IIc might
	be smart enough to handle this, but older machines are not.

	so be sure to have your emulator in iie-enhanced mode (not just iie)

	Hack: copy the FXXX range into the language card so it doesn't
	matter?
